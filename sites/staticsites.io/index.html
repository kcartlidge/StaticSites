        <h2>About Static Sites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Run <strong>all</strong> your <strong>static sites</strong> on a
                <strong>single port</strong> with just
                <strong>one server</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have your sites running <strong>HTTPS</strong> with absolutely
                <strong>zero configuration</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No</strong> need for a traditional <strong>web server</strong> deploy, meaning <strong>tiny resource</strong> usage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Production ready</strong> with a <strong>single file</strong> deployment and <strong>great performance</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Open source</strong> codebase for peace of mind:
                <a href="https://github.com/kcartlidge/StaticSites" target="_blank">
            view the code on my GitHub.
          </a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installing</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you are wanting to run on your own local machine or a server/cloud instance makes no difference. Follow the steps below to get started.
        </p>
        <h3>Download the relevant version</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/builds/macos/StaticSites">Download the Mac OS version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/linux/StaticSites">Download the Linux version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/windows/StaticSites.exe">Download the Windows
            version</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Check the dependencies and install</h3>
        <p>
            <em>There are no dependencies. There is no installation needed.</em><br/> Just drop the download into a suitable folder and it is ready to run.
        </p>

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>
            The suggested approach is to copy your static site(s) into place in folders alongside the downloaded application, named as per the domains. The folder tree would look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>/home/karl/my-sites
    StaticSites
    /sites
        /staticsites.io
            index.html
        /www.example.com
            index.html</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can then run the server:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cd /home/karl/my-sites
./StaticSites -sites ./sites -verbose -port 8000 -local staticsites.io</code></pre>
        <p>
            This will launch <em>all</em> sites found in the <code>./sites</code> folder on port <code>8000</code> (which is the default anyway, but shown here for completeness). The sites will all start responding to requests to their domain name, provided
            of course that your DNS routes them in. The <code>verbose</code> option switches on the display of requests as they are received.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default you won't see any sites responding at <code>localhost</code> as routing is done by domain name, so you would usually need to browse to the domain to get a response. To work around this the <code>local</code>parameter allows you
            to nominate one site to run as <code>localhost</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Serving using HTTPS (the browser padlock)</h3>
        <p>
            Set the port to <code>443</code>, the standard for HTTPS. Static Sites will handle obtaining any certificates, caching them, and renewing them (for all the sites).
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time a site is hit there may be a slight delay whilst the certificate is updated, but subsequent hits to that site will automatically use the cached version.
        </p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sites are scanned at startup, so adding/removing a site requires a StaticSites restart. Changing the <em>content</em> of a site folder
                <em>does not</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site folders should be the complete domain name, including subdomain, but without any protocol. Like <code>example.com</code> or <code>blog.kcartlidge.com</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site folders should be accessible to the relevant user, especially if you have the server launch automatically (eg with <em>pm2</em> or <em>supervisor</em>) and it runs under a different one.
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of sites you can serve is limited by the number of host names LetsEncrypt will allow in their certificates (around
                <code>100</code>), as a single certificate is maintained for all the domains. There are also <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/" target="_blank">rate
              limits applied by LetsEncrypt
              for certificate issuance</a>, but certificates are only requested when port <code>443</code> is used so simply avoid that port until ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                No content caching is currently implemented. Static sites are extremely light on resource usage, and the Static Sites server itself is hugely lighter than fully fledged traditional web servers (eg just a 9mb binary using 18mb RAM on Debian 4.19), so performance
                should not be an issue. If it is, static sites are also prime candidates for fronting by services like <em>CloudFlare</em> or equivalent.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no HTTP to HTTPS redirect. I'm not in favour of supporting that; supporting a redirect reduces the chance of bookmarks/links being updated. If you need HTTP for some reason, run a second StaticSites instance on port 80 looking at the same site(s).
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Simplicity</strong> is the driving force. You get configuration free serving of all your static sites using HTTPS with the smallest effort possible from a self-hosted facility.
