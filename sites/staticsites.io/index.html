        <h2>About Static Sites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Run <strong>all</strong> your static <strong>websites</strong> on a <strong>single port</strong> with just
                <strong>one server</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have your sites running <strong>HTTPS</strong> with absolutely <strong>zero configuration</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No need</strong> for a traditional <strong>web server</strong> deploy, meaning <strong>tiny resource</strong> usage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Production ready</strong> with a <strong>single file</strong> deployment and <strong>great performance</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Open source</strong> codebase for peace of mind:
                <a href="https://github.com/kcartlidge/StaticSites" target="_blank">
                    view the code on my GitHub.
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installing</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you are wanting to run on your local machine or a server/cloud instance makes no difference. Follow the steps below to get started.
        </p>
        <h3>Download the relevant version</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/builds/macos/StaticSites">Download the Mac OS version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/linux/StaticSites">Download the Linux version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/windows/StaticSites.exe">Download the Windows version</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Check the dependencies and install it</h3>
        <p>
            <em>There are no dependencies. There is no installation needed.</em><br/> Just drop the download into a suitable folder and it is ready to run.
        </p>

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>
            Copy your static site(s) into place in folders alongside the downloaded application, named as per the domains. Remember that on Linux servers upper/lower case matters. The folder tree should look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>/home/karl/my-sites
    StaticSites
    /staticsites.io
        index.html
    /www.example.com
        index.html</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can then run the server:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cd /home/karl/my-sites
./StaticSites -sites ./sites -port 8000 -local staticsites.io</code></pre>
        <p>
            This will launch <em>all</em> sites found in the <code>./sites</code> folder on port <code>8000</code> (which is the default anyway, but shown here for completeness). The sites will all start responding to requests to their domain name provided
            of course that your DNS routes them in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't expect to see any sites responding at <code>localhost</code> by default, as the routing is done by domain name so you would usually need to browse to the domain. In order to make things easier for local work, the <code>local</code> parameter
            allows you to nominate one site to run as <code>localhost</code> so there is no need to set the DNS or do any workarounds when you want to work on it as it will then respond directly to <code>localhost</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Serving using HTTPS (green padlock)</h3>
        <p>
            Just set the port to <code>443</code>, which is the standard for HTTPS. Static Sites will handle obtaining any certificates, caching them, and renewing them (for all the sites).
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time a site is hit there may be a slight delay whilst the certificate is updated, but subsequent hits to that site will automatically use the cached version and not be subject to that brief pause.
        </p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sites are scanned at startup, so adding/removing a site requires a StaticSites restart. Changing the <em>content</em> of a site folder <em>does not</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site folders should be the complete domain name, including subdomain, but without any protocol, like <code>example.com</code> or <code>blog.kcartlidge.com</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site folders should be accessible to the relevant user if you have the server launch automatically (eg with <em>pm2</em> or <em>supervisor</em>) and it runs under a different user.
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of sites you can serve is limited by the number of host names LetsEncrypt will allow in their certificates (around
                <code>100</code>), as a single certificate is maintained for all the domains. There are also <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/" target="_blank">rate limits applied by LetsEncrypt
                for certificate issuance</a>, but certificates are only requested when port <code>443</code> is used so simply avoid that port until ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                No caching is currently implemented. Static sites are extremely light on resource usage, and the Static Sites server itself hugely lighter than fully fledged traditional web servers, so performance should not be an issue. If it is, static sites are also
                prime candidates for services like <em>CloudFlare</em> or equivalent.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="footer">
            <p>
                <strong>Simplicity</strong> is the driving force. You get configuration free serving of all your static sites using HTTPS with the smallest effort possible from a self-hosted facility. Requests for things such as Markdown processing, folder
                listings and so forth are beyond that scope.
