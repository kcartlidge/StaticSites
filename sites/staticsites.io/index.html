        <h2>How Static Sites can help</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Run <strong>all</strong> your static <strong>websites</strong> on a <strong>single port</strong> with just
                <strong>one server</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have your sites running <strong>HTTPS</strong> with absolutely <strong>zero configuration</strong> needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No need</strong> for a traditional <strong>web server</strong> deploy, meaning <strong>tiny resource</strong>                usage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Production ready</strong> with a <strong>single file</strong> deployment and <strong>great performance</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Open source</strong> codebase for peace of mind:
                <a href="https://github.com/kcartlidge/StaticSites" target="_blank">
                    view the code on my GitHub.
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installing Static Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you are wanting to run on your local machine or a server/cloud instance makes no difference. Follow the steps below
            to get started.
        </p>
        <h3>Download the relevant version</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/builds/macos/StaticSites">Download the Mac OS version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/linux/StaticSites">Download the Linux version</a></li>
            <li><a href="/builds/windows/StaticSites.exe">Download the Windows version</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Check the dependencies and install it</h3>
        <p>
            <em>There are no dependencies. There is no installation needed.</em><br/> Just drop the download into a suitable
            folder and it is ready to run.
        </p>

        <h2>Running Static Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Create a <code>sites.ini</code> file alongside the application. Run the following, replacing <code>example.com</code>            with your site's domain:
        </p>
        <code>
            cd &lt;download-folder&gt;<br/>
            echo "example.com = example.com" > sites.ini<br/>
        </code>
        <p>
            Copy your static site into place in a folder alongside the downloaded application, named as per the domain. You can then
            run the server:
        </p>
        <code>
            ./StaticSites -local example.com -sites sites.ini -port 8000
        </code>
        <p>
            This will launch <em>all</em> sites listed in the <code>sites.ini</code> file on port 8000 (which is the default,
            but shown here for completeness). The sites will all start responding to requests to their domain name provided
            of course that your DNS routes it in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>local</code> parameter allows you to nominate a site to run as <code>localhost</code> so there is no
            need to set the DNS or do any workarounds when you want to run things locally.
        </p>

        <h3>Serving using HTTPS (green padlock)</h3>
        <p>
            Just set the port to 443, which is the standard for HTTPS. Static Sites will handle obtaining any certificates, caching them,
            and renewing them (for all the sites).
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time a site is hit there may be a slight delay whilst certificates are obtained, but subsequent hits will automatically
            use the cached version and not be subject to that brief pause.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to note</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The site folders as specified in the <code>sites.ini</code> file should either be relative to the folder
                you launch the server from, or fixed to your home folder (eg <code>~/sites</code>), or absolute paths that
                will work from anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of sites you can serve is limited by the number of host names LetsEncrypt will allow in their certificates (around
                100).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="footer">
            <p>
                <strong>Simplicity</strong> is the driving force. You get configuration free serving of all your static sites
                using HTTPS with the smallest effort possible from a self-hosted facility. Requests for things such as Markdown
                processing, folder listings and so forth are beyond that scope.
